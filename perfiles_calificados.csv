As the API and apps economy continues to evolve, a design problem arises for API designers when internal systems are too complex to expose directly to app developers. The goal of an API Facade Pattern is to articulate those internal systems and make them useful and consumable by app developers. I used APIGEE to create api facade. Sometimes I had to work with different technologies to plan and to understand how to integrate the systems. In APIGEE (backendside), often I used Java and javascript to manage the requests/responses from/to clients. Clients were mobile apps (iOS or Android). I helped the frontend developers to reach the backend interfaces. Sometimes, I created Android prototypes to facilitate the frontend tasks and to allow a better understanding of the interfaces of the backend. My last task was the integration of OAuth2 in a mobile app using of three IDPs (Google, Facebook and SinaWeibo) and an account manager (CloudMinder)."",""duration"":""Feb 2014 Dec 2018 4 years 11 months"",""duration_short"":""4 years 11 months"",""end_date"":""Dec 2018"",""start_date"":""Feb 2014"",""subtitle"":""MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive"",""title"":""System Integrator""}],""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/company/interactiveamsterdam""},{""company"":""R4I - Research for Innovation"",""company_id"":null,""location"":""Benevento, Italia"",""positions"":[{""description"":"""",""duration"":""Feb 2013 Dec 2013 11 months"",""duration_short"":""11 months"",""end_date"":""Dec 2013"",""start_date"":""Feb 2013"",""subtitle"":""R4I - Research for Innovation"",""title"":""Software developer (intern)""}],""url"":""""},{""company"":""Qadra"",""company_id"":null,""location"":""Napoli, Italia"",""positions"":[{""description"":"""",""duration"":""Jan 2010 Feb 2010 2 months"",""duration_short"":""2 months"",""end_date"":""Feb 2010"",""start_date"":""Jan 2010"",""subtitle"":""Qadra"",""title"":""Consultant""}],""url"":""""},{""company"":""EuroAppalti"",""company_id"":null,""location"":"""",""positions"":[{""description"":"""",""duration"":""Jun 2009 Oct 2009 5 months"",""duration_short"":""5 months"",""end_date"":""Oct 2009"",""start_date"":""Jun 2009"",""subtitle"":""EuroAppalti"",""title"":""Software Developer""}],""url"":""""}]","[{""degree"":""Master of Science in Computing Engineering (Laurea Specialistica in Ingegneria Informatica)"",""end_year"":"""",""field"":""Facoltà di Ingegneria"",""meta"":""Activities and Societies: Software Engineering, Software Testing and Software Development Thesis entitled Una piattaforma distribuita per l’advertisement di eventi in mobilità (A distributed platform for the advertisement of events in mobility)"",""start_year"":"""",""title"":""Università degli Studi del Sannio-Benevento"",""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/school/universit%C3%A0-degli-studi-del-sannio-benevento/""},{""degree"":""Bachelor's Degree in Computing Engineering (Laurea in Ingegneria Informatica)"",""end_year"":"""",""field"":""Facoltà di Ingegneria"",""meta"":""Activities and Societies: Automation Engineering, Control Engineering and Software Development Thesis entitled Identificazione e simulazione di un modello di batteria a ioni di litio (Identification and simulation of a model of lithium-ion battery)"",""start_year"":"""",""title"":""Università degli Studi del Sannio-Benevento"",""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/school/universit%C3%A0-degli-studi-del-sannio-benevento/""}]","[{""meta"":""Issued Dec 2020 Credential ID GR671212926CZ"",""subtitle"":""PeopleCert"",""title"":""ITIL® Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management""},{""meta"":""Issued May 2020 Credential ID H417-8247 See credential"",""subtitle"":""Microsoft"",""title"":""Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals""}]",2.0,1,0,2,2,1,44,Media calidad

Na maanden van voorbereiding werd in 2010 de eerste vestiging van Brownies&downieS in Veghel geopend. De combinatie van kwalitatief goede gerechten in combinatie met de unieke service van de bijzondere medewerkers zorgde voor een nieuw uniek horeca concept. Dit concept bleek dan ook direct een doorslaand succes ondanks de zware tijden in de horeca. In de loop van 2011 ontstond daarom het idee om een tweede vestiging in de directe omgeving te openen. Dit idee werd verder uitgewerkt en zo werd in 2012 de tweede vestiging in Sint-Oedenrode geopend. Op dat moment waren er geen verdere groeiplannen en werd de focus door Thijs en Teun gelegd op de twee vestigingen. Dit veranderde toen Sander van Brussel in 2012 aanklopte bij Thijs en Teun met de vraag of hij een eigen vestiging kon openen. Vanuit deze vraag werd in 2012 besloten een franchiseformule te schrijven. Vanaf dat moment ging het hard, en werden verschillende vestigingen door franchisenemers geopend. Op moment van schrijven telt Brownies&downieS 40 vestigingen. Brownies&downieS heeft de doelstelling om in 2020 87 vestigingen te hebben verdeeld over heel Nederland en België. Door onze interesse in het concept zijn Rutger Kanis en ik in maart 2016 in contact gekomen met Brownies&downieS. Wat begon met een idee is werkelijkheid geworden, wij zijn een eigen vestiging in Zwolle begonnen!"",""duration"":""Sep 2016 - Present 5 years 8 months"",""duration_short"":""5 years 8 months"",""end_date"":""Present"",""start_date"":""Sep 2016"",""subtitle"":""Brownies&downieS"",""title"":""Eigenaar vestiging Zwolle""}],""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/company/brownies&downies""},{""company"":""Vila Etiketten B.V."",""company_id"":""vila-etiketten"",""location"":""Breda"",""positions"":[{""description"":""Vila Etiketten is de expert in etiketten.

I begin with a tour of the RTLS applications and then serve you the details of what goes into an RTLS and what the various RTLS technologies are. Then, I plunge into the practical things that you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks and attacks. After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make an RTLS work for you. Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS makes some topics more relevant than others.
